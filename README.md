# E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

## Project Overview
This project is about building a full e-commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It helps to get hands-on experience with real-world coding and tools.

## Key Features of the Project
- **MERN Stack:** The project use MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
- **REST API Creation:** Learn how to make scalable APIs.
- **Authentication:** Create login and register features in a secure way.
- **Database Schema Design:** Make structured data models using MongoDB.
- **Backend Development:** Set up strong server-side logic with Node.js and Express.
- **Frontend Development:** Use React.js for a nice and interactive user interface.

## Core Concepts Covered
### Overview of the MERN Stack
MERN stack is a popular tech stack for making full-stack web apps. It let developers use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, which makes development easy.

### REST API Structure and Endpoints
REST API helps client and server talk to each other using HTTP methods. In this project, you will create API endpoints for:
- **User Authentication:** Register and login users.
- **Product Management:** Add, edit, and get product data.
- **Order Handling:** Manage customer orders.

Each API endpoint will talk with the database and send data in JSON format.

### Basics of Database Schema Design
Schema design in MongoDB means deciding how data will be stored and linked to make sure it is easy to get and manage.

### Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication checks user identity before giving access to some features. In our e-commerce app, users must log in before they can buy things or see sensitive data.

## Submission Guidelines
- Push your repository to GitHub and make sure it's public.
- Share your GitHub repository link in the assignment submission.
- Add a **README** file with a small description and summary of **Milestone 1: Project Overview**.

## Next Steps
- **Set Up the Development Environment:** Install needed tools and dependencies.
- **Understand Server-Client Interaction:** Learn how frontend talks with backend using APIs.
- **Set Up a Simple Server:** Make a basic server using Node.js and Express.
